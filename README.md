# Sentiment-analysis
This project centres on Sentiment Analysis
This project centres on Sentiment Analysis and Polarity Detection, a
field within natural language processing (NLP) that involves
determining the sentiment orientation of text data, particularly
whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The
increasing availability of text data from social media platforms,
review sites, and other online sources has driven demand for
automated sentiment analysis tools capable of assessing and
categorizing large volumes of text. This project uses two different
machine learning models: a Naive Bayes model and a Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) neural network model.
The project steps include preprocessing the text data, converting it
into a format suitable for modelling, training both machine learning
models, and evaluating their performances in terms of accuracy and
classification metrics. Results reveal insights into the effectiveness of
each model, providing an in-depth comparison and understanding of
their strengths and limitations for sentiment analysis tasks. This
document aims to serve as a comprehensive guide, from setup to
deployment, for building sentiment analysis tools.
